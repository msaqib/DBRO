The file "RA Work Documentation.pdf" contains instructions on how to set up the testbed. 
The folder "MySQL Code" contains code that inserts the datasets into a MySQL backend.
The folder "PostgreSQL Code" contains code that inserts the datasets into a PostgreSQL backend.
The folder "Python-Cassandra" contains code that inserts the datasets into a Cassandra backend. 
A total of three datasets were tested. Two of these data sets - tweets and crime - are included with this repository. The third dataset consists of MIR Flickr images dataset first reported and used in the paper, "The MIR Flickr Retrieval Evaluation" by Huiskes and Lew published in ACM International Conference on Multimedia Information Retrieval, 2008.
